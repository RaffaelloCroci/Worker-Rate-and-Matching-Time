# Worker-Rate-and-Matching-Time
This query serves the purpose of examining worker rates and the duration it takes to confirm bookings across different worker roles. It achieves this by combining data from multiple tables, applying specific filters, and performing time-related calculations to offer valuable insights into the booking process. 
This query was developed during my tenure at an on-demand staffing agency in London, which facilitated job placements through a mobile app available on both Android and iOS platforms.
